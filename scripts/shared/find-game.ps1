.SYNOPSIS
    Bridge between install.cmd and the shared game-detection module.
.DESCRIPTION
    Called by each mod's install.cmd / uninstall.cmd. Looks up the
    game by id in cameraunlock-core/data/games.json, uses the shared
    detection pipeline (Steam appmanifest > Steam folder > GOG > Epic
    > Xbox > env var), and writes the resolved values as a batch
    script the caller can `call` to pick them up as `set` variables:

        GAME_PATH            - resolved install path (required)
        GAME_EXE             - leaf filename of the executable (for
                               the "game is running" tasklist check)
        GAME_EXE_RELPATH     - full relative path of the executable
                               (same as Executable in games.json)
        GAME_DISPLAY_NAME    - human-readable name (for messages)
        ENV_VAR_NAME         - env var that overrides detection

    If `-GivenPath` is supplied and points at an existing directory,
    it's used verbatim (trusting the caller - matches the step 1
    "trust %~1" semantics baked into the install.cmd templates).

.PARAMETER GameId
    Game id from games.json (hyphen-lowercase, e.g. "obra-dinn").

.PARAMETER OutFile
    Path to write the batch script to. install.cmd passes a %TEMP%-
    derived filename.

.PARAMETER GivenPath
    Optional caller-supplied path (install.cmd's %~1). If set and it
    is an existing directory, it is used verbatim instead of running
    detection.

.EXITCODE
    0 - game resolved, OutFile written
    1 - bad input (unknown game id, missing games.json, OutFile write failed)
    2 - game not installed (detection ran cleanly but nothing matched)
